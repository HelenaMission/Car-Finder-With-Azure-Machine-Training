## Task Overview

We prototyped an application to showcase an AI solution that helps users find similar cars based on uploaded car images. The goal was to build an application capable of recognizing motor vehicles, with an added bonus distinguished between certain types of vehicles (e.g., sedans vs. hatchbacks) using a cloud-based AI service on Microsoft Azure.
